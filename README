rbget: ReviewBoard patch downloader
http://github.com/cyberguijarro/rbget

rbget is a simple Python script that contacts an existing ReviewBoard
server and uses its web API to authenticate and download the patch associated
with a specific review id.

In addition, rbget can feed the diff data to common tools such as "patch" or
"git-apply".

REQUIREMENTS

Python (2.6 or higher)
ReviewBoard
GIT (only for use with GIT)
patch (only for use with patch)

INSTALLATION

On UNIX-like operating systems, just copy "rbget.py" to any of the folders
in your PATH environment and rename it as you like ("yapd" is my choice).

USAGE

rbget's syntax is:

$ rbget host-name[:port] review-id [git|patch|none]
